            <h2>My background</h2>

            <p id = 'aboutMe'>My name is Tanner Percival and i am currently 18 years old as of january 2019. When i was in high school, i took alot of interest in the arts, and sciences. psychology intrueged me, AP enviromental was engaging, and the art classes were expressive. Skip ahead 6 months after graduation, and i am participating in 10-14 hour days, pursuing the chance to possibly land a job as a web developer.  </p>

            <p id = 'aboutBrinley'>I have 6 animals. My dogs name is Brinley. One day i was driving down the freeway, and i saw a little puppy dart across 2 lanes of high-speed traffic! I quickly pulled over and opened my door, and before i could jump out, brinley jumped in. She sat on my lap for the 1 hour car ride to the vet to check for a chip, then home. Brinley got her name becuase of her coat, which is brindle in color. Brinley is part lab and pitbull, which makes an amazing combination! </p>
